1864bed	2016-08-11	 (origin/CHNSDK-7339-FileTransfer, CHNSDK-7339-FileTransfer)	CHNSDK-7339: Improve app installation execution time.  - Issue.   In case of not supporting sftp, installer was using stream-buffers to read   an app file and pipe it to the ssh stream. While this procedure,   stream-buffers read the file as default chunk-size 1KB.   Increasing chunk-size can improve the installation execution time.  - Replacing stream-buffers with the builtin stream.   Previously installer put stream-buffers because the old nodejs (v0.8) stream   did not work as intended.   The data was not pumped out to the ssh channel stream.   Now the recent nodejs stream works as intended. There is no issue to pipe it   to the ssh stream.  - Etc.   a. Add a simple test suit for installer   b. Fix a missing callback param in installer function
